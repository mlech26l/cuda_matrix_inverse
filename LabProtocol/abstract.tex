\begin{abstract}
The problem of computing a inverse matrix is introduced. Furthermore the difficulties and obstacles of implementing such procedures on massive parallel Graphics Processing Units are stated. Finally matrix inversion algorithms for Nvidia's CUDA platform are compared to the serial equivalent algorithms for off-the-shelf x64 processors.
